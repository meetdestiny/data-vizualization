## Introduction

I have analyzed whole data provided on github link for this assignment. While Seattle data contains more data than SFO,
but as we are supposed to compare both the cities, I ended up filter data of Seattle to match the period between 
06/01/2014 to 08/31/2014. This is the only period for which data is available for both cities.
